# Dilshod Turab's custom NeoVim configuration

To use this configuration you need to clone the source code of the config and run nvim command. But NeoVim has to be installed to your machine first!
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dilshodturab/nvim-config.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```
